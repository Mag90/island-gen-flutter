Ordered List for High-Quality Terrain Rendering (Minimizing Code Rewrites)

1. Raymarching & Distance Estimation

	1.	Adaptive Step Size: Implement dynamic step sizing with a slope-based heuristic.
	2.	Higher MAX_STEPS: Increase to 256-512 for detailed raymarching.
	3.	Refinement Steps: Add binary search refinement (5-6 steps) for precise intersections.
	4.	Signed Distance Fields (SDF): Integrate a more accurate distance estimation method (SDF) early to avoid later rewrites.

2. Normal Calculation

	5.	Multi-Scale Normals: Blend normals calculated at different scales.
	6.	Smoother Normals: Sample multiple surrounding points and average the results for stability.

3. Lighting & Shading

	7.	PBR Shading: Implement a physically-based BRDF (Cook-Torrance).
	8.	Ambient Occlusion: Add multi-scale AO for crevices and large-scale features.
	9.	Soft Shadows: Integrate shadow raymarching for realistic soft shadows.
	10.	Specular Highlights: Add dynamic specular reflections based on the lighting environment.

4. Terrain Texturing

	11.	Multi-Layer Texturing: Blend multiple textures based on height, slope, and biome type.
	12.	Detail Maps: Integrate normal and roughness maps for micro-details.
	13.	Procedural Noise: Overlay Perlin or Worley noise to break texture repetition and add realism.

5. Water Effects

	14.	Reflections & Refractions: Add fresnel-based reflections and refractions for water surfaces.
	15.	Foam & Shorelines: Implement procedural foam and shoreline blending effects.
	16.	Caustics: Apply caustic patterns on submerged terrain.

6. Atmospheric Effects

	17.	Fog & Scattering: Implement height-based fog and atmospheric scattering.
	18.	Color Gradients: Add sky color gradients based on altitude and view direction.

7. Post-Processing

	19.	Tonemapping: Apply ACES or Filmic tonemapping for HDR rendering.
	20.	Color Grading: Add color grading to tweak contrast and saturation.
	21.	Gamma Correction: Ensure final output uses proper gamma correction (e.g., pow(color, 1.0 / 2.2)).

8. Performance Optimization

	22.	Level of Detail (LOD): Implement LOD to simplify distant terrain rendering.
	23.	Caching: Cache raymarch results or intermediate calculations to boost performance.
