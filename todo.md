	1.	2D Height Map Generation: Improve 2D height map generation using Perlin noise as a base noise function.
	2.	Terrain Editor Shaders: Create shaders to render the terrain in a 3D view.
	3.	Wireframe Mode: Enable a wireframe mode to visualize the mesh structure.
	4.	Checkerboard Texture: Apply a checkerboard texture for debugging UV mapping.
	5.	Multiple Noise Layers: Use multiple Perlin noise layers with adjustable parameters for more control.
	6.	Isolate Layers: Implement the ability to isolate and view specific layers for fine-tuning.
	7.	Blend Modes: Include blend modes like add, multiply, max, and min for each layer.
	8.	Smoothing Options: Add smoothing options to control terrain roughness.
	9.	Noise Mask: Implement a noise mask to control where noise patterns are applied.
	10.	Terrain Mesh Density: Provide options to adjust the terrain mesh density.
